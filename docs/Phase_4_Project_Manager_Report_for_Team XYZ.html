  <h1>CSE 216 Project Manager Report: Phase 4, Team XYZ</h1>
  <h3>List your team members, providing name, email, and role for this
  project.</h3>
  <div class="answer"></div>

  <div class="dark">
   <h2>LUApps</h2>

   <h3>If your team is participating in LUApps, describe the features that
    you are adding, and any corners that you decided to cut in order to meet
    the early LUApps deadline.</h3>
   <div class="answer"></div>

   <h3>
    If your team is participating in LUApps, you may leave the rest of this
    document blank.
   </h3>

  </div>

  <div class="light">
   <h2>Back-End Server</h2>

   <h3>Describe the mechanism you are using to interact with Google Drive.
    Are you using an existing library?  Are you using the REST API?  Are you
    using some other mechanism?</h3>
   <div class="answer"> Alex followed the code from a guide to create a class called Quickstart in the same folder as App.java that authorizes connections and gets a Google drive service connection. The pair of credentials used to form a connection with the google drive is stored in a seperate static JSON file that is read in when making the connection. Alex is using the Google Oauth client to authorize the user. He is using the Google API client to interact with files on the drive.  </div>

   <h3>
    Explain how you are using memcachier to cache documents.
   </h3>
   <div class="answer"> Alex uses the Google drive retrieved ID as the key and caches the contents of the file he is sending to the Google drive. Alex is also using memcachier to replace the functionality of the hashTable from phase 3. Alex created an object that gets connections to the memcachier. The object is used whenever a connection is needed to the memcachier. The object takes a username, password, and server and uses those to create a connection object that connects to the server. The object can be used to put things into the cache and retrive data from the cache. The object is used to abstract the process of connecting to both the file cache and the secretkey cache.  </div>
   
   <h3>Is the back-end code appropriately organized into files / classes /
   packages?</h3>
   <div class="answer"> Alex only used one package. He also reorganized App.java into multiple files. Their are 11 java files and 1 test file in the package.  </div>

   <h3>Are the dependencies in the pom.xml file appropriate? Were there any
   unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
   <div class="answer"> Alex added the google api dependencies, the google api drive service dependencies, Oauth dependencies, spy memcachier dependencies, and a repository for spy memcachier. I also added the dependencies needed for heroku to work. </div>

   <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the back-end
   server?</h3>
   <div class="answer"> Alex's code succeeds at sending files to the Google drive. Alex's code is functional up to phase 4, and the greatest struggle Alex faced was implementing the functionality from phase 1 to phase 4. It should be noted that the phase 1 backend was done by Alex during the intermediate catchup phase. </div>

   <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current back-end server
   implementation?</h3>
   <div class="answer">None. Alex succeeded at getting his code to work. </div>
   
   <h3>Describe any refactoring that was performed to reduce technical debt
    from the last phase</h3>
   <div class="answer"> Alex changed the process of accepting the number of likes from the frontend to a process where the number of likes is retrieved from a database. The number of likes is inserted into the backend database. Alex cleaned up methods that has unnecessary arguments. Alex used many databases to retrieve data rather than relying on data from rest APIs. Alex wrote one method to get connections to the database rather than establishing connections before every method. Alex made the tests more rigourous. </div>
