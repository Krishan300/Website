# Luna Phase 2 Testing

**Edited by Alex Van Heest**

I have done what I can with the code I've been given so far. A lot of this is still pending completion of other parts of the project, which will not all be in time for the Phase 2 submission. What I've done here is as much as I can without writing other people's parts.

**What needs to be done before we can start Phase 3?**

* ~~Phase 1 Android Testing (w/ Espresso)~~
* ~~Phase 2 Android Testing (w/ Espresso)~~ -- as done as it can be until one of us actually does any of Android
* ~~Phase 1 Frontend Testing (w/ Jasmine)~~ -- as done as this can be until we have a working implementation of the frontend and backend combined
* Phase 2 Frontend Testing (w/ Jasmine) -- since none of phase 2 frontend is actually done, this part will need to be done at some point during Phase 3......
* ~~Phase 1 Backend Testing (w/ JUnit)~~ -- done by Kieran
* ~~Phase 2 Backend Testing (w/ JUnit)~~ -- some of these methods are still not going to pass since the methods they rely on haven't yet been writtend despite being in the specs of the project; as such, they'll need to be updated before phase 3, though they're logically valid tests
