# CSE 216 Luna Phase 1

**Who is working on our project?**

Phase 1 breaks down into five parts:

* Project Manager (Alex Van Heest): The project manager is in charge of helping to design the system by which the frontend and backend developers communicate. The PM is also in charge of keeping the group focused and communicating amongst themselves. A PM is designed to help guide group development, doing code reviews for each team member so that the code can be deemed testworthy, readable, and has a second pair of eyes over it before deployment.
* Backend Developer (Charles Mandala): The backend developer is in charge of providing a mechanism to receive incoming data from the frontend and insert it into a database. This currently involves designing methods for handling data updates and inserts and writing REST API endpoints that correspond with the frontend developer. This will be written with Java and the Spark Java package.
* Frontend Developer (Robert Salay): The frontend developer is in charge of creating the UI and the mechanisms for prompting users for data, receiving data from users, providing the data in a readable format to the backend, and displaying the resulting data. This part is written in TypeScript and HTML.
* Android Developer (Krishan Madan): The Android developer is in charge of designing and deploying an Android interface that users can interact with to view messages, create messages, and "like" messages. They will also store these messages as JSON. This part will be build in Android Studio.
* Testing (Kieran Horan): The tester is in charge (for this part) of testing backend and frontend code to ensure that there are as few unpredicted behaviors as possible. This entails designing tests for methods in the backend using JUnit and testing the frontend using Jasmine. These tests will be run each time the code is attempted to be packaged before deployment to ensure that our code is as stable as possible.

**What still needs to be done before Phase 2?**

There is still a lot of work to be done in order for our group to officially complete Phase 1. This can be broken down into sections by role:

* Backend: The backend code is currently not working properly. The Tester and Backend Developer have sat down and tried to get it working, but so far to no avail. Thus, we have no idea whether or not the backend "works," which of course needs to be fixed before moving on to Phase2. (Obviously, this also means that this code doesn't officially "pass" the tests designed by the Tester.)
* Frontend: The frontend code is being held back by issues with NPM and Jasmine. From what I can determine, there is some configuration issue that is holding back the deployment here, possibly among other issues. As such, we have no clear idea yet whether or not we can rely on this code or not.
* Android: The Android code needs to be cleaned up a lot or completely redone. There are many parts that haven't been attempted, and the parts that were attempted are far from complete.
* Testing: Due to time constraints, the testing is very minimal and needs a lot more thoroughness. However, in order for testing to be ready to finish the work necessary, every other part needs to be complete or at least further along than it is now.
