There is still a lot of work to be done in order for our group to officially complete Phase 1. This can be broken down into sections by role:

* Backend: The backend code is currently not working properly. The Tester and Backend Developer have sat down and tried to get it working, but so far to no avail. Thus, we have no idea whether or not the backend "works," which of course needs to be fixed before moving on to Phase2. (Obviously, this also means that this code doesn't officially "pass" the tests designed by the Tester.)
* Frontend: The frontend code is being held back by issues with NPM and Jasmine. From what I can determine, there is some configuration issue that is holding back the deployment here, possibly among other issues. As such, we have no clear idea yet whether or not we can rely on this code or not.
* Android: The Android code needs to be cleaned up a lot or completely redone. There are many parts that haven't been attempted, and the parts that were attempted are far from complete.
* Testing: Due to time constraints, the testing is very minimal and needs a lot more thoroughness. However, in order for testing to be ready to finish the work necessary, every other part needs to be complete or at least further along than it is now.
